		<h1>What is <span class="osName">drauger os?</span></h1>
		<p>
			Drauger OS is an <a href="https://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu-based</a> Linux desktop gaming distribution that ships with many modifications and optimizations over stock Ubuntu that are intended to improve gaming performance and the gaming experience. From simple changes such as swapping <a href="https://gnome.org" target="_blank">Gnome</a> out for the light-weight <a href="https://xfce.org" target="_blank">Xfce Desktop Environment</a> and using a dark GTK theme by default, to more complex changes such as using a kernel compiled in-house and replacing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio" target="_blank">PulseAudio</a> with <a href="https://pipewire.org" target="_blank">Pipewire</a>. Drauger OS is built from the ground up with our primary focus on performance.

		<h1>Is <span class="osName">drauger os</span> right for you?</h1>
		<p>Whether you're an Avid PC Gamer looking to squeeze more performance out of your rig, you want to have more control, or simply want to try out Linux, Drauger OS may be right for you.</p>
		<br>
		<p>But, Drauger OS is not for the faint of heart.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Like it's namesake, Drauger OS is capable of breathing new life
			into old computers. However, again like it's namesake, it
			requires maintainance from time to time, and issues cropping up
			are not uncommon. Drauger OS is developed by a small, passionate
			team who don't get paid anything for their work. As such, bugs
			may sometimes be common. Therefore, users who are new to Linux
			may want to look elsewhere to gain experience before taking the
			plunge with Drauger OS.</p>
